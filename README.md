# jamstack 101
Frontend test developed by Nathan, designed and copyrighted by [Monogram](https://monogram.io/)

- Framework: Next.js
- Style Library: TailwindCSS + SASS
- Pizazz: Blender + Three.js

The page is developed using Next.js, with TailwindCSS combined with SASS (I do love nested styles) and a little Three.js flair. I was originally going to go with Svelte Kit as the stack, but as this is a "Next.js Engineer" position, I decided I go with Next.js first and if given the opportunity in the future, will happily jump on a Svelte project.

Monogram,
Thank you for this opportunity to submit the frontend test. I am happy to answer any questions you may have regarding my file structure or thought process.
